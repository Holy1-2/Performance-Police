The Performance Police

A little desktop app that shows how your computer “feels” based on resource usage.

CPU at 95%? → “Your computer is screaming internally.”

RAM full? → “Please stop opening 47 Chrome tabs, psychopath.”

Hard disk full? → “Delete your homework folder before your teacher sees it’s empty.”

Useful: system monitoring.

Funny: sarcastic personification.
